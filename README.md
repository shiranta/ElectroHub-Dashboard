# ElectroHub-Dashboard
The Electro Hub, Sales & Profit Analytics Dashboard is a complete end to end business intelligence solution built using Power BI, Power Query (M language), and DAX to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights for an electronics retail company. The dashboard analyzes top and bottom five products by sales, profit, and quantity sold, visualizes sales trends across daily, monthly, quarterly, and yearly levels, and highlights the relationship between sales and profit to identify performance drivers. Users can dynamically compare sales, profit, and quantity sold between any two selected time periods, evaluate the average discount offered across discount categories, track the total number of orders, and explore detailed order level data including sales, profit, discount, net sales, and all remaining fields using interactive filters such as product, date, customer ID, and promotion category. In addition, the report provides city-wise sales analysis, helping management understand geographic performance, making this project a practical example of applying advanced DAX, efficient data modeling, and interactive reporting for real-world decision making.
